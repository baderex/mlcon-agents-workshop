Here is a quick guide:\\n\\n1. **Create a Docker Compose file**: You need to create a `docker-compose.yml` file. A basic configuration would look something like this:\\n   ```yaml\\n   version: \\'2\\'\\n   services:\\n     zookeeper:\\n       image: wurstmeister/zookeeper:3.4.6\\n       ports:\\n         - \"2181:2181\"\\n     kafka:\\n       image: wurstmeister/kafka:latest\\n       ports:\\n         - \"9092:9092\"\\n       environment:\\n         KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER: \"zookeeper:2181\"\\n         KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: \"PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092\"\\n         KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: \"PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT\"\\n         KAFKA_LISTENERS: \"PLAINTEXT://0.0.0.0:9092\"\\n       depends_on:\\n         - zookeeper\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Run Docker Compose**: Once you\\'ve created the `docker-compose.yml` file, navigate to the directory where it is located and run:\\n   ```bash\\n   docker-compose up\\n   ```\\n   This command will pull the necessary images and start the Kafka and Zookeeper services.\\n\\n3. **Check if the services are running**: You can verify if Kafka and Zookeeper are running by using:\\n   ```bash\\n   docker ps\\n   ```\\n   This will show you the running containers and you should see entries for both Kafka and Zookeeper.\\n\\n4. **Interacting with Kafka**: Now that Kafka is running, you can start producing and consuming messages using any Kafka client, or you can run your own producer and consumer scripts.\\n\\nThis setup is basic and may require additional configurations based on your environment and use case. Make sure to check Docker documentation for more complex configurations if needed.\\n', 'source': 'OWN_KNOWLEDGE'}\n"
